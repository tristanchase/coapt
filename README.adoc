= How to Use *coapt*

== Overview

*coapt* is a collection of *apt*-related scripts arranged in a logical order.  It will:

. Create a snapshot of your currently installed packages (with the optional *apt-snapshot* script, which I didn't write)
. Autoremove unused packages if the -a or --autoremove option is passed
. Update packages
. Hold any packages you specify at their current version (in the directory `$HOME/.local/share/coapt/hold`)
. Upgrade packages
. Release any hold on packages
. Clean the package cache
. Ask you if would like to reboot the system, if necessary

This script is designed to minimize problems encountered during upgrades.

== Installing

Copy and paste this into your favo[u]rite terminal:

....
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tristanchase/coapt/master/install.sh)"
